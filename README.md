# HighSchoolJava
First ever Java course codes for assignments for 2010 - 2011 school year of high school

The assignments were divided by the three terms Fall, Winter, and then Spring.

These assignments were a long time ago, so I do not remember the details exactly or if all of the code is the best in terms of design or even all completely finished, but this was my first real exposure to an actual programming language.
