Section 1.5 Assignment

The following terms are included in bold 
in the text book.  Find each term in any 
one of many glossaries available
on the Internet.  Include the definition from 
the Internet and include the web address.  Also, write a definition
in your own words.  Check to make
sure that the definition conforms to
the intent in the textbook because
some terms have more than one meaning.

1. (5 pts) software engineering 
Internet: "the application of a systematic, disciplined, quantifiable
 approach to the development, operation, and maintenance of software;
 that is, the application of engineering to software."
 http://wiki.ercim.eu/wg/SoftwareEvolution/index.php/Terminology#S
Own Words: the act of creating and perfecting working programs
2. (5 pts) structured programming
Internet: A computer programming technique that follows a top down
 design approach with block oriented structures.http://www.natemurphy.net/glossary.html
Own Words: a method of programming that works with object related codes
3. (5 pts) top-down programming
Internet: (is also known as step-wise design) is essentially the breaking down of
 a system to gain insight into its compositional sub-systems. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top-down_programming
Own Words: taking apart large tasks of programming and working with smaller, easier parts
4. (5 pts) bottom-up design 
Internet: is the piecing together of systems to give rise to grander systems, thus making the
 original systems sub-systems of the emergent system http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top-down_programming
Own Words: Taking pre-existing or smaller codes to work up to larger tasks
5. (5 pts) module 
Internet: a general systems concept, typically defined as a continuum describing the degree to which
 a system’s components may be separated and recombined http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Module
Own Words: an event that can be called to use in bottom-up programming
6. (5 pts) information hiding
Internet: the principle of segregation of design decisions in a computer program that are most likely
 to change, thus protecting other parts of the program from extensive modification if the design
 decision is changed http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_hiding
Own Words: a way of shortening and concealing information of a module or smaller code so as to
 prevent much modification to the original code
7. (5 pts) object-oriented programming 
Internet: a programming paradigm that uses "objects" – data structures consisting of data
 fields and methods together with their interactions – to design applications and computer
 programs http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming
Own Words: programming with sets of data and their interactions or "objects"
8. (5 pts) object
Internet: any entity that can be manipulated by the commands of a programming language, such as
 a value, variable, function, or data structure http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_(computer_science)
Own Words: sets of data combined with their interactions
9. (5 pts) state
Internet: a unique configuration of information in a program or machine. It is a concept that
 occasionally extends into some forms of systems programming such as lexers and parsers. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_(computer_science)
Own Words: an object's data
10. (5 pts) messages
Internet: a form of communication used in parallel computing, object-oriented programming, and
 interprocess communication. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_(computer_science)
Own Words: notes sent through processes to transfer data and communicate certain functions
11. (5 pts) polymorphism
Internet: a programming language feature that allows values of different data types to be
 handled using a uniform interface http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(computer_science)
Own Words: when same-class objects respond to messages in a different way
12. (5 pts) class
Internet: a construct that is used as a blueprint (or template) to create objects of that class
 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_(computer_science)
Own Words: the model for objects in a class
13. (5 pts) subclasses 
Internet: a class that inherits some properties from its superclass http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subclass_(computer_science)
Own Words: like a miniature class that has the same features as the class above it (the one that contains it)
14. (5 pts) inherit
Internet: a way to compartmentalize and reuse code by creating collections of attributes and behaviors called objects
 which can be based on previously created objects http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inheritance_(object-oriented_programming)
Own Words: the superclass's way to pass down attributes to a subclass, allowing it to use some of the same code
